# DSLAB-TrainingData-Webpage
## Installation

Linux (ubuntu):

```sh
apt-get install python3.6
apt-get install pip3
pip3 install sqlalchemy
sudo apt install python3-mysqldb
sudo apt install apache2 php nodejs npm
```
In order to make everything work, all you need is to install the dependencies and create a small web server to host the webapp, in order to install the node dependencies just go into the folder and run npm-install, later just run nodejs index.js. Also, don't forget to change the config.js and config.php with the database and server config values.
